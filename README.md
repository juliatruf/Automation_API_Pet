This project is dedicated to automated testing of RESTful API using Python and the Pytest framework. It verifies API functionality on various endpoints including user authentication, creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting resources.
The test data is collected in separate files for reuse and separation from the test logic.
Pytest fixtures are utilized for reusable setup such as user authentication or test data creation.
